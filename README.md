Movie-Database-SQL
Contains: 
          1. All the tables (in .csv format)
          2. A .sql file containing all the queries I ran on the MOVIE DATABASE
          3. A .sql file containing all the solutions to the above queries.
          
This database has been taken from w3resource and the queries are imported from there as well.
The solution file has been created by me and contains my take on the queries.

All the queries are run on MYSQL WORKBENCH.
